# FactorioCalculator
A console application which calculates the production required to make a specified amount of an item in Factorio.
Simply type in the material desired (science units are named by their colour) and then the number of production centers you wish to have. Alternatively, a specific per second value
of units can be input if the first prompt is left blank.
The ingredients required are listed, and the materials to make each ingredient are also listed recursively with an indent for each step.
